        <p class="firstdiv">My name is Ejiroghene Enwefah. Technology helps me organize my life  and work better,
            allows me to access information at the moment i need it, helps me buy and sell stuff
            easier, enables me to find best price for the items i might need. Which is why 
            I love Technology. To some extent, It is like magic in that most often, it can do 
            something repeatedly that most people never knew was possible. In short,
            Technology stimulates my Imagination.

        <p class="seconddiv">Thus far, I have learnt about Git and Github for version control.
         I also learnt about how HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) 
        are two of the core technologies for building Web pages. HTML provides the structurre of the page, 
        CSS the (virtual and aural) layout, for a variety of devices. CSS makes the front-end of a 
        website shine and it creates a great user experience. Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing
        to the eye and likely much harder to navigate. In addition to layout and format, CSS is 
        responsible for font color and more.</p>

        <!-- <h2>Third Section</h2> -->
        <p class="thirddiv">The CSS Border property is used to specify the style, color and size on an element.
            Whereas Padding refers to the interior space between the element content and 
            the element border. And Margin is used to define the space arount the elements. It 
            clears an area around the element. Styles for border or margin may be dotted, dashed,
            solid, groove, hidden , inset or outset depending on the specification of the developer.
